## 200c 
* Instructor: Pablo Colapinto
* Teaching Assistant: Keehong Youn

## Note
Please email Kee ahead of any meetings to give him time to research your problem.
There will be no class the day before Thanksgiving, November 23rd.
This class will instead be made up on December 7th.

## Course Description

This class introduces the algorithmic design of movement by developing programs with the programmable graphics pipeline of OpenGL in all its flavors (WebGL, OpenGL ES, and OpenGL).  We will use linear and geometric algebras as core synthesis tools, combining artistic intuition with spatial mathematics to generate real-time graphics on a computer.  Our algorithmic techniques will explore trigonometric and step functions, matrices and quaternions, forward and inverse kinematics, 3D mesh processing, fluid fields, color, and higher dimensions, among other topics. Both independent and collaborative practice will lead to constructive thinking, as we learn how to build systems for synthesizing space "de novo".


We will remain programming-language agnostic -- we will use both C++ and javascript in our examples, but we will focus on the graphics programming logic and mathematical details that can applied in any language. 

## Goal: Constructive Thinking

1. **Build** your natural abilities to see in your mind, and to program what you see.

2. **Construct** deep geometric understanding of worldbuilding techniques.

3. **Develop** your natural abilities to teach what you see.

Each week of 200c consists of a lecture with accompanying online tutorial.  This will be followed by a task
that we will start together in class.

1-WebGL and Shaders
2-Matrices and Quaternions
3-Kinematics
4-Curves and Surfaces
5-Fluids and Particle Systems
6-Color
7-Higher Dimensions

## So what is this class really about?

geometry -> motion -> space -> graphics -> seeing -> you.
