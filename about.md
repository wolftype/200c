This class is about YOU:

1- This class is about geometry, which means it is about motion.

2- This class is about motion, which means it is about space.

3- This class is about space, which means it is about graphics.

4- This class is about graphics, which means it is about seeing.

5- This class is about seeing, which means it is about you.

6- This class is about you.


More specifically, this is an introduction to computational geometry for virtual environments using linear and geometric algebras as core synthesis tools. Combining artistic intuition with spatial mathematics, we will use C++, javascript, and OpenGL to generate real-time graphics on a computer, investigating how our structures may be realized in both virtual and physical form.  Our algorithmic techniques will explore Euclidean and non-Euclidean spaces and transformations (rotations, twists, bends), 3D mesh processing, forward and inverse kinematics, fluid fields, and emergent processes, among other topics. Both independent and collaborative practice will lead to constructive thinking, as we build a modular software framework for synthesizing space "de novo".
