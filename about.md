* Instructor: Pablo Colapinto, gmail -> wolftype
* Teaching Assistant: Keehong Youn, younkeehong@gmail.com (please email your TA ahead of any meetings to give him time to research your problem)

## Note
There will be no class the day before Thanksgiving, November 23rd.
This class will instead be made up on December 7th.

## Course Description

This class will cover the mathematics and geometry of movement, and on developing programs with the graphics pipeline of OpenGL in all its flavors (WebGL, OpenGL ES, and OpenGL).  We will focus on computational geometry for virtual environments using linear and geometric algebras as core synthesis tools. Combining artistic intuition with spatial mathematics, we will use C++, javascript, and OpenGL to generate real-time graphics on a computer, investigating how our structures may be realized in virtual form.  Our algorithmic techniques will explore Euclidean and non-Euclidean spaces and transformations (rotations, twists, bends), 3D mesh processing, forward and inverse kinematics, fluid fields, and emergent processes, among other topics. Both independent and collaborative practice will lead to constructive thinking, as we learn how to build a software framework for synthesizing space "de novo".

It is in a sense programming-language agnostic -- we will use C++ and javascript in our examples, but we will focus on the graphics programming logic and mathematical details that can applied in any language.

## Goal: Constructive Thinking

1. **Build** your natural abilities to see in your mind, and to program what you see.

2. **Construct** deep geometric understanding of worldbuilding techniques.

3. **Develop** your natural abilities to teach what you see.

## So what is this class really about?

1- This class is about geometry, which means it is about motion.

2- This class is about motion, which means it is about space.

3- This class is about space, which means it is about graphics.

4- This class is about graphics, which means it is about seeing.

5- This class is about seeing, which means it is about you.

6- This class is about you.
