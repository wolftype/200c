Each week of 200c consists of a lecture with accompanying online tutorial.  This will be followed by a task
that we will start together in class.

Midterm: Create a 2D Print

*Assignment:* Into the Shade

Using WebGL, create a context and compile a fragment shader that changes based on some input uniform time.

*Assignment:* Catching some Rays

*Assignment:* Build a Bug

Using what we have learned about forward and inverse kinematics, design an animated creature that responds to mouse input.

*Assignment:* World-Building

Procedural terrain generation
